/*!  Search for and label clusters in a lattice.

    This function implements the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm [1] for labelling
    clusters in a lattice.

    @param lattice pointer to lattice to be analyzed. The lattice must already
        have all clusters labeled.
    @param rows the number of rows in the lattice.
    @param columns the number of columns in the lattice.
    @param cluster_sizes_count pointer to integer where to store the total number
        of different cluster sizes present in the lattice.
    @param cluster_sizes pointer to array where to store the sizes of the clusters.
    @param sizes_counts pointer to array where to store the amount of clusters
        that have the size given by the matching position in the cluster_sizes
        array.
    @param filled_count pointer to integer where to store the total number of
        occupied nodes (optional).
    @param empty_count pointer to integer where to store the total number of
        empty nodes (optional).

    @note filled_count and empty_count are optional and their calculation can be
        skipped by passing a NULL pointer. However, either both are returned or
        neither. Therefore if only one pinter is NULL the other value won't be
        calculated either.

    @warning cluster_sizes and cluster_sizes must be manually free'd by the user.

    @see label_clusters for a function that labels clusters in a lattice.
