/*!  Search for and label clusters in a lattice.

    This function implements the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm [1] for labelling
    clusters in a lattice.

    @param rows the number of rows in the lattice.
    @param columns the number of columns in the lattice.
    @param cluster_sizes_count pointer to integer where to store the total number
        of different cluster sizes present in the lattice.
    @param cluster_sizes pointer to array where to store the sizes of the clusters.
    @param sizes_counts pointer to array where to store the amount of clusters
        that have the size given by the matching position in the cluster_sizes
        array.
    @param filled_count pointer to integer where to store the total number of
        occupied nodes.
    @param empty_count pointer to integer where to store the total number of
        empty nodes.

    @warning cluster_sizes and cluster_sizes must be manually free'd by the user.
